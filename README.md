# Music Generation Using Artificial Intelligence

A deep learning Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) RNN model used for generating a completely new series of music based upon the knowlegde of the sequential music that the model learns during training

This model is built on top of tensorflow using its keras API. This model is capable of generating new music sequence which depicts a significant move of ML/AI towards revolutionizing the music industry.
